1. It does. https is an extension of http. Https uses transport layer security to encrypt its header information, or SSL.
    Therefore, we can't get what's inside the header, which contains the pathname.

2. No, it doesn't. Although https uses encryption for the pathname, the hostname or the port number is not encrypted because it happens in the network protocol, and that's not encrypted
    So yeah, hacker can still gain information on what websites have you browsed.
